<p>
  Social media study and analysis brings researchers from many fields into a single setting. Even though the tasks of these researchers are varied, data visualization and analytics plays an important role. For industry and academics alike, visualization of social media data helps with hypothesis formation and supports the explanation of phenomena.
</p>
<p>
  The Workshop on Social Media Visualization (SocMedVis) will be held in conjunction with
  <a href='http://www.icwsm.org/'>the International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM'12)</a>
  in Dublin, Ireland on 4th June 2012. The workshop is a venue for presentation of research and applications of visualization of social media data.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and industry practitioners interested in visual and interactive techniques for social media analysis to discuss their potential application to the social sciences, humanities, and industry.  We solicit contributions that discuss novel techniques and applications of visualization and visual analytics approaches to social media data sources.
