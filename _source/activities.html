<p>
  The availability of social media data presents remarkable opportunities and challenges for visual analytics researchers.  The capacity to search, filter, analyze, and visualize real-time streams enables users to find patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Business and marketing professionals can track commentaries about their products, while political analysts can take the pulse of public sentiment.  Among the many challenges is to filter the data to focus on relevant items in the context of adversaries who wish to influence public perceptions.  Integrating statistical methods, text analytics, and visualization is essential, but creating compelling images with meaningful commentaries will keep researchers busy for decades.

  Attendee Fast Forward
</h2>
<p>
  This session will take place at the beginning of the workshop and will allow any participant of the workshop to freely address the attendees for one minute. The session is free form and participants are encouraged to state their background, goals, and topics of interest with respect to visualization and social media. This event is an opportunity to understand the interests of all attendees and provides a venue to introduce directions of research. This session, at the
  <a href='http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/textvis2011'>Interactive Visual Text Analytics for Decision Making workshop</a>,
  was vibrant and was an excellent way to encourage participant interaction.

  Applications Panel
</h2>
<p>
  This panel includes participants with varied perspectives on the application of visualization to other academic disciplines and industry to understand social media data sources. Panel members are not from the visualization community, but are rather researchers from the social sciences and humanities as well as members of industry. The panel will include:

  Visualizing Online Communities: Applications from a literary and cultural studies perspective
</h4>
<p>
  Online social media texts, and the communities they both form and represent, present new methodological challenges to researchers in the arts and humanities, requiring reassessments of concepts such as author, audience and text, as well as new methods of textual selection and analysis. This talk aims to briefly outline ways in which visualization and network analysis techniques are currently being used to approach such challenges in humanities and social sciences research, and to provide an overview of an ongoing humanities-based research project utilizing visualization techniques, based on a collaboration between representatives from UCD's Clique Research Cluster and the Humanities Institute of Ireland.

  Data scientists at Twitter strive each day to derive insights from petabytes of data in our Hadoop-based data warehouse. Among other tasks, they try to understand user behavior and how various Twitter features are used, as part of a continuous process of improving and refining the service. Visualization is an important tool for accomplishing this, alongside Pig, R, and other tools for statistical analysis.
